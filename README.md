Description:
------------
This project had several requirements, all to be performed using JavaScript:
    - Retrieve user input for a string to be tested using MeaningCloud's Sentiment Analysis algorithm
    - Send that string to the local node server
    - Have the local node server retrieve a stored API key so it's not exposed on the client side
    - Combine the API key with the user text to create a URL that is then sent to MeaningCloud from the server-side
    - Pass data from the returned JSON file to the client side
    - Display the returned sentiment data on the client side via the DOM

In addition, the text sent by the user is verified so
an empty string is not passed to the server.

User Input:
-----------
User input is accomplished via a text area on the *index.html* page. Once the
user has entered text in the **Enter text to be analyzed**
field they can click the **submit** button; an event
listener then runs code to validate and pass this text to
the node server (via *formHandler.js* and *fieldChecker.js*)

Server Side
----------
On the server side (code in */server/index.js*) the API
key generated by MeaningCloud is retrieved from a .env file,
combined with the validated user text, and additional
data including language and preferred dictionary to create
a single string. The server then sends this string to
MeaningCloud where the user text is analyzed and sentiment
values assigned. This data is returned as a JSON file; the
server pulls select key pairs from the JSON file
(specifically) "agreement" (yes / no), "confidence score
(0-100)", and "irony" (yes / no) and adds them to a data
object, then passes the contents of that object back to the
client side.

**Note:** For a full list of the returned data returned in
the JSON file see https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis/doc/2.1/examples

The API key is retrieved from an .env file on the server
and the API call is made from the server so none of this
information is ever exposed on the client side.

Client Side (Returned Data and Updating DOM)
--------------------------------------------
Once the server returns data the *formHandler.js* file
updates the DOM so the user can see the results; for
ease in user comprehension the *formHandler.js* script
changes the "agreement" value to a yes / no value.
